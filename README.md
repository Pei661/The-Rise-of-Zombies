Story: When the spirits of the dead are no longer falling, the clock rings at midnight. By the time people realize the danger coming, it's already too late.
The zombies roared and charged at the player. Players subconsciously make instinctive resistance, wanting to fight against zombies, but the zombies will continue to get stronger. Until the nature of the virus is exposed, when the virus completely changes the world, it will also be devastated.

Description: Since this Addon is currently in the initial testing phase, there are many creatures that are not yet complete, so please understand that. Ben Addon prevents zombies from being burned during the day, and cows will actively attack the player.

BUG: Zombies will only attack the player, it seems that the enemy seeking function is not fully written, and neither villagers nor iron golems will be hostile to zombies

This addon may later add a new biome: the Infected biome. This biome is spread from a new type of block called "Infested Block". The biome is more suitable for zombie spawning, and the player will spawn 1-3 zombies within 4 blocks around the "infected block".

What do you think? You ready? Humans, get ready to fight the zombies to the end!<br/>
To add, a small portion of the Infect biome is inspired by: SR: Parasite mod<br/>

故事：当亡灵们不再堕落，那午夜的钟声响起时。人们意识到危险的到来的时候，一切都已经为时已晚了。
僵尸们发出咆哮，冲向了玩家。玩家下意识的做出本能的反抗，想要对抗僵尸，奈何僵尸们会不断变强。直至病毒们的本性暴露，当病毒彻底改变这个世界的时候，也就生灵涂炭了。

介绍：目前由于该addon为初次测试阶段，因此有很多生物都还不够完善，还请各位能够谅解。本addon使僵尸不会在白天被燃烧，牛会主动攻击玩家。

BUG：僵尸只会攻击玩家，似乎是寻敌功能没写完整，村民和铁傀儡都不会对僵尸产生敌意

本addon可能后面会添加一种新的生物群系：感染群系。该群系由一种名为“感染方块”的新方块蔓延而来。且改群系更适合僵尸生成，玩家站在“感染方块”上会在其周围4格范围内生成1-3只僵尸。

怎么样？准备好了吗？人类们，准备和僵尸抗争到底吧！<br/>
补充一句：感染方块 群系的小部分灵感来源于：SR：寄生虫模组<br/>
改页面已经做好中英对照了，不用翻译。
